# Mini Project: Git Version Control Basics  

## Objective  

Demonstrate the challenges of collaborative file editing **without** a version control system (VCS) by manually managing file versions. This highlights the inefficiency and risks of overwriting work in team projects.  

---

## Steps to Reproduce  

**Step 1 - Simulating Manual Version Control (Without Git)**  

---

## Problem

* File Overwrite Risk: If both save to index.html, the last save overwrites the other’s work.

* Manual Merging: To combine changes, someone must manually copy-paste from both versions into a new file.

* No History: No record of who changed what or when.
