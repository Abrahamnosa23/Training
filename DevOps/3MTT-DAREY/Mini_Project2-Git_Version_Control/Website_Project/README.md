# Mini Project: Git Version Control Basics  

## Objective  
Demonstrate the challenges of collaborative file editing **without** a version control system (VCS) by manually managing file versions. This highlights the inefficiency and risks of overwriting work in team projects.  

---

## Steps to Reproduce  
**Step 1 - Simulating Manual Version Control (Without Git)**  




---

## Problem
* File Overwrite Risk: If both save to index.html, the last save overwrites the other’s work.

* Manual Merging: To combine changes, someone must manually copy-paste from both versions into a new file.

* No History: No record of who changed what or when.

## Observations


| Issue	              | Consequence                              |
| No version history	| Can’t track changes or revert mistakes.  |
| Simultaneous edits	| Work is lost if files are overwritten.   |
| Manual merging	    | Time-consuming and error-prone.          |
