## ✅ Purpose of Screenshots

Screenshots are included in this repository for the following reasons:

- 🔍 **Proof of Work**: Demonstrates the practical hands-on progress made during each exercise or installation
- 📝 **Documentation Support**: Enhances the written steps in the main project `README.md` by providing visual reference
- 🧠 **Learning Retention**: Reinforces learning by pairing visual feedback with technical execution
- 📂 **Submission Transparency**: Ensures that every requirement, installation, or configuration step can be verified by the instructor or reviewer

## 🚀 Next Steps

This folder will continue to grow as I:
- Complete more DevOps labs and real-world projects
- Set up cloud infrastructure and pipelines
- Take configuration snapshots of tools like Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, etc.

Each image added will be referenced either in the corresponding subfolder's `README.md` or the main repository's documentation.
