## Purpose of Screenshots

Screenshots are included in this repository for the following reasons:

- **Proof of Work**: Demonstrates the practical hands-on progress made during each exercise or installation
- **Documentation Support**: Enhances the written steps in the main project `README.md` by providing visual reference
- **Learning Retention**: Reinforces learning by pairing visual feedback with technical execution
- **Submission Transparency**: Ensures that every requirement, installation, or configuration step can be verified by the instructor or reviewer

---

## How to View

To view any screenshot:
1. Click into the `screenshots/` folder on GitHub
2. Select the image file
3. GitHub will display a preview with zoom controls

Alternatively, clone the repo and open the image locally in your preferred image viewer.

## Next Steps

This folder will continue to grow as I:
- Complete more DevOps labs and real-world projects
- Set up cloud infrastructure and pipelines
- Take configuration snapshots of tools like Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, etc.

Each image added will be referenced either in the corresponding subfolder's `README.md` or the main repository's documentation.

_This folder is part of my hands-on learning journey through the Darey.io DevOps training powered by 3MTT._
