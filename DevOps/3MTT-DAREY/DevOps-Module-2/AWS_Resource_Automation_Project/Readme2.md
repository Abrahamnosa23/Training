# AWS Resource Automation Project

This project guides you through creating a Bash shell script to automate the provisioning of key AWS resources: EC2 instances and S3 buckets. The script utilizes functions for modularity and arrays for efficient, loop-based resource creation.

Based on the provided project information, I have successfully learned and implemented a shell scripting solution for automating AWS resource creation. My learning encompasses creating modular functions for provisioning EC2 instances and S3 buckets, utilizing environment variables for configuration, implementing error handling through exit status checks ($?), and working with arrays to manage multiple department-specific bucket names. I've mastered AWS CLI commands for both EC2 instance creation (aws ec2 run-instances) and S3 bucket operations (aws s3api create-bucket), including proper parameter substitution and region specification. The project has strengthened my understanding of automating cloud infrastructure through scripting while maintaining code organization through functions and efficient data handling through arrays for scalable resource deployment.
