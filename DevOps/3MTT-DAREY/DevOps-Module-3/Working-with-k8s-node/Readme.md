# üöÄ GitHub Actions CI/CD: Advanced Continuous Delivery Summary

## üß≠ Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of **advanced Continuous Delivery (CD)** practices using **GitHub Actions**, focusing on **automated versioning (Semantic Versioning - SemVer)** and **secure cloud deployment** to **AWS S3 and CloudFront**.  

It forms the capstone component of the CI/CD curriculum, reinforcing core DevOps automation concepts while emphasizing **security**, **traceability**, and **cloud efficiency**.

## üéØ Objectives

| Goal | Description | Achieved |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Automated Versioning** | Automatically assign SemVer tags (e.g., v1.0.0 ‚Üí v1.0.1) on each push to `main`. | ‚úÖ |
| **Secure Cloud Deployment** | Deploy built artifacts to AWS S3 and invalidate CloudFront cache automatically. | ‚úÖ |
| **End-to-End CI/CD Automation** | Link CI (build/test) and CD (deploy) workflows seamlessly. | ‚úÖ |
| **Implement Strong Security** | Use encrypted GitHub Secrets instead of hardcoded credentials. | ‚úÖ |
| **Provide Verification Evidence** | Include logs, screenshots, and cloud validation outputs. | ‚úÖ |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Continuous Delivery (CD) Practices

### üè∑Ô∏è Automated Versioning and Tagging

**Goal:**  
Automatically generate version tags following the **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** standard.

**Implementation:**

- The **`actions/github-tag-action@v1`** GitHub Action is used for version bumping.
- Triggered on push to the `main` branch.
- The workflow reads existing tags, increments the `PATCH` version (default), and creates a new annotated tag.

**Workflow Snippet (`versioning.yml`):**
```yaml
name: Automated Versioning

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  tag:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create Semantic Version Tag
        uses: anothrnick/github-tag-action@v1.64.0
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          default_bump: patch
```


‚úÖ Expected Output:

A new Git tag is automatically created after each main branch push.

Example: v1.0.0 ‚Üí v1.0.1

‚òÅÔ∏è Secure Deployment to AWS

Goal:
Deliver built application files to AWS S3 for hosting and ensure immediate availability via CloudFront invalidation.

Workflow Snippet (deploy.yml):

name: Deploy to AWS (S3 + CloudFront)

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Build and Sync to S3
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build
          aws s3 sync ./build s3://your-bucket-name --delete

      - name: Invalidate CloudFront Cache
        run: aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
             --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID \
             --paths "/*"


üîê Security Requirements:

All credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) are stored as Encrypted GitHub Secrets.

IAM policy follows least privilege principle (only required S3 and CloudFront permissions).

üß© 2. Project Flow Diagram (Textual Representation)

Below is the full lifecycle of the project ‚Äî from code push to deployment.

Stage	Trigger / Action	Purpose / Description
1. Code Commit	Developer pushes code to main.	Triggers workflow automation.
2. Continuous Integration (CI)	a. Matrix Build (Node 14.x, 16.x) ‚Äî runs tests across versions.
b. Dependency Caching ‚Äî reuses node modules.
c. Code Quality Check ‚Äî ESLint ensures code standards.	Ensures code stability and quality.
3. Continuous Delivery (CD)	a. Automated Versioning ‚Äî assigns SemVer tags.
b. Secure Deployment to AWS ‚Äî uses GitHub Secrets.
c. CloudFront Invalidation ‚Äî refreshes content globally.	Automates version control and deployment pipeline.

‚úÖ This design guarantees an end-to-end automated workflow ‚Äî zero manual steps from commit to production.

üîê 3. IAM Policy (Least Privilege Example)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "S3DeploymentAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "CloudFrontInvalidate",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation",
        "cloudfront:GetInvalidation"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

üß† 5. Troubleshooting Guide
Issue	Cause	Solution
Workflow not triggering	Branch filter mismatch	Ensure workflow triggers main branch.
Access denied (AWS)	IAM policy too restrictive	Confirm permissions: s3:PutObject, cloudfront:CreateInvalidation.
Missing build directory	No build step in workflow	Add npm run build before deployment.
YAML validation error	Indentation/syntax issue	Use YAML Lint
.
CloudFront not updating	Wrong distribution ID	Verify ID in AWS console.
