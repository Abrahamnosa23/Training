# üê≥ Working with Docker Containers

## üß≠ Introduction

Docker containers are **lightweight**, **portable**, and **executable** units that package an application and all its dependencies together.  
They ensure that applications run consistently across different environments ‚Äî from local machines to production servers.

In the previous step, we worked with Docker images.  
Now, we‚Äôll dive deeper into **working with Docker containers** ‚Äî from launching and managing containers to understanding their full lifecycle.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Running Containers

To create and run a container, use the `docker run` command followed by the image name.

Example: Launch a container from the **official Ubuntu image**.

```bash
docker run ubuntu
```

Example Output:

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-85-134:~$ docker run ubuntu
ubuntu@ip-172-31-85-134:~$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                 CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS                    NAMES
1f7ce9f4a261   ubuntu        "/bin/bash"             22 seconds ago      Exited (0) 21 seconds ago                           confident_albakyan
644192dc6d81   dockerfile    "/docker-entrypoint..." About an hour ago   Up About an hour           0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp     infallible_babbage

```

The example above shows that the container is created but not running.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Starting a Container

You can start an existing container using the docker start command:

```bash
docker start CONTAINER_ID
```

To verify it‚Äôs running:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Launching Containers with Options

Docker provides several options to customize container behavior.

‚úÖ Example: Set Environment Variables

You can define environment variables inside a container using the -e flag:

```bash
docker run -e "MY_VARIABLE=my-value" ubuntu
```

This passes an environment variable MY_VARIABLE with the value my-value into the container.


## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Running Containers in the Background

By default, containers run in the foreground, meaning your terminal session is attached to it.
To run a container in the background (detached mode), use the -d flag:

```bash
docker run -d ubuntu
```

This allows you to keep using your terminal while the container continues running in the background.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Container Lifecycle

Containers follow a defined lifecycle, including the stages:

1. Create
2. Start
3. Stop
4. Restart
5. Remove

You can manage these stages using Docker commands.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start a Stopped Container

```bash
docker start container_name
```

## ‚èπÔ∏è Stop a Running Container

```bash
docker stop container_name
```

## üîÑ Restart a Container

```bash
docker restart container_name
```

Each of these commands helps manage your container without needing to rebuild or recreate it.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Removing Containers

Once you no longer need a container, remove it using:

```bash
docker rm container_name
```

This deletes the container, but note:
The associated image remains on your system ‚Äî you can still use it to create new containers later.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Summary of Container Lifecycle Commands

|Action	          |Command	                 |Description                    |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Run a container	|docker run ubuntu	       |Create and start a new container|
|View all containers	|docker ps -a	|Show running and stopped containers|
|Start container	|docker start <container_id>	|Start a stopped container|
|Stop container	|docker stop <container_id>	|Stop a running container|
|Restart container	|docker restart <container_id>	|Restart an existing container|
|Remove container	|docker rm <container_id>	|Delete a container|


## üß© Side Hustle Task: Docker Container Operations

Follow the tasks below to reinforce your understanding of Docker container operations.

1. Start a Container and Run a Simple Command

- Use the official Ubuntu image to start a container.

If not available locally, pull it from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```

Run a simple command inside the container (e.g., view system information):

```bash
docker run ubuntu uname -a
```

2. Stop the Container and Verify its Status

Stop the running container:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

Verify the status:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Confirm that the Status column shows the container as ‚ÄúExited‚Äù.

3. Restart the Container and Observe Changes

Restart the stopped container:

```bash
docker restart <container_id>
```

Verify its status again using:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Observe any differences in uptime or behavior after restarting.

4. Remove the Container

Stop the container if it‚Äôs still running:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

Remove it from your system:

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

Confirm it‚Äôs no longer listed:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

In this module, you‚Äôve learned how to:

- Launch and manage Docker containers
- Run containers in the background
- Customize container behavior with environment variables
- Control the full container lifecycle
- Safely remove containers when done

These are essential Docker fundamentals ‚Äî mastering them prepares you for more advanced topics like:

- Networking between containers
- Docker Compose
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
