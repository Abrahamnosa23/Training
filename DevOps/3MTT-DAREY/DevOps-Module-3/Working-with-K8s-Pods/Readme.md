## ⚙️ 1. Understanding Pods in Kubernetes

A **Pod** is the **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.  
It represents **one or more tightly coupled containers** that share:
- The same **network namespace** (can communicate via `localhost`).
- The same **storage volumes**.
- The same **lifecycle and configuration context**.

> 🧠 Think of a Pod as a "box" that holds one or more containers that work together as a single application unit.

### 🌍 Why Pods Matter
- Provide **encapsulation** for containers.  
- Enable **co-located services** (e.g., app + sidecar container).  
- Simplify **scaling and orchestration** in clusters.

---

## 🧰 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning:
- Minikube and kubectl are installed and configured.
- Minikube cluster is running (`minikube start`).
- Basic understanding of Docker and container concepts.

---

## 🚀 3. Managing Pods in Kubernetes

You’ll use the `kubectl` CLI tool to interact with your Minikube cluster and manage Pods.

---

### 🟢 Step 1: List All Pods

```bash
kubectl get po -A
```

### Purpose:
Displays all Pods running across all namespaces (-A = All Namespaces).

Example Output:

```sql
Copy code
NAMESPACE     NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   coredns-5dd5756b68-srdms          1/1     Running   0          171m
kube-system   etcd-minikube                     1/1     Running   0          171m
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube           1/1     Running   0          171m
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube  1/1     Running   0          171m
kube-system   kube-proxy-7wgnh                  1/1     Running   0          171m
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube           1/1     Running   0          171m
```

✅ Verification Command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

🟠 Step 2: Inspect a Specific Pod
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n kube-system
```

Purpose:
Displays detailed Pod configuration — useful for troubleshooting or reviewing resource allocation.

Example Command:

```bash
kubectl describe pod coredns-5dd5756b68-srdms -n kube-system
```

Key Information Displayed:

Field	Description
Name	Name of the Pod
Namespace	Logical grouping of resources
Node	Node hosting the Pod
Containers	Containers running in the Pod
Events	Lifecycle events (e.g., Created, Started, Scheduled)
Status	Running, Pending, or Failed

Example Output (Partial):

📸 Screenshot Required:

Capture kubectl describe pod output showing container image, node, and events.

🔴 Step 3: Delete a Pod
bash
Copy code
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n kube-system
Example Command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl delete pod coredns-5dd5756b68-srdms -n kube-system
Expected Output:

nginx
Copy code
pod "coredns-5dd5756b68-srdms" deleted
Verification Command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get po -A
Expected Output (After Deletion):

sql
Copy code
NAMESPACE     NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   coredns-5dd5756b68-nfx2r         1/1     Running   0          15s
Note: Kubernetes automatically recreates critical system Pods such as CoreDNS.

📸 Screenshot Required:

Show deleted Pod confirmation and the new Pod automatically created by Kubernetes.

🧱 4. Containers in Kubernetes
Definition and Purpose
A Container is a lightweight, standalone package containing everything needed to run an application — code, runtime, and dependencies.

In Kubernetes:

Containers live inside Pods.

Pods provide the execution environment and shared networking/storage.

Multiple containers in a Pod can communicate via localhost.

Analogy:
If a Pod is an “apartment,” containers are the “rooms” inside — separate but sharing the same address and utilities.

🧩 5. Defining Pods with Containers (YAML Example)
Here’s a simple Pod manifest defining one container inside a Pod:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
Save as: nginx-pod.yaml

Deploy the Pod:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
Verification:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
Expected Output:

sql
Copy code
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod    1/1     Running   0          15s
📸 Screenshot Required:

Show terminal output after creating the nginx-pod with status “Running”.

🔍 Inspect Pod Logs
bash
Copy code
kubectl logs nginx-pod
Expected Output:

swift
Copy code
127.0.0.1 - - [12/Oct/2025:15:22:00 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
📸 Screenshot Required:

Capture Pod logs to demonstrate container activity.

❌ Delete the Pod
bash
Copy code
kubectl delete -f nginx-pod.yaml
Output:

nginx
Copy code
pod "nginx-pod" deleted
📸 Screenshot Required:

Capture Pod deletion confirmation message.

🧰 7. Troubleshooting Guide
Issue	Cause	Solution
Pod stuck in Pending	Insufficient node resources	Increase Minikube CPU/memory using minikube config set
kubectl command not found	CLI not installed	Install with sudo snap install kubectl --classic
Pod not deleted	Pod part of system namespace	Ensure you target correct namespace using -n flag
Container image pull error	Network issue or invalid tag	Check internet and image name (e.g., nginx:latest)
Pod recreated automatically	System-managed Pod (CoreDNS, Kube-proxy)	Normal behavior; Kubernetes self-healing in action

🧩 8. Summary of Key Learnings
Pods are the core execution units of Kubernetes, encapsulating containers.

Every Pod can host one or more containers that share resources and context.

Managing Pods involves listing, describing, and deleting using kubectl.

YAML manifests define Pods declaratively for repeatable deployments.

Minikube provides an excellent local platform for testing Kubernetes deployments safely.

🧭 9. Reflection
Working with Kubernetes Pods provided a foundational understanding of how containerized applications are deployed and managed in a cluster.
I learned how Pods encapsulate containers, how to create and inspect them using YAML, and how Kubernetes maintains system Pods automatically.
This hands-on experience built confidence in using kubectl and understanding orchestration concepts that scale into real production environments.
