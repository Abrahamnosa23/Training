# üöÄ Introduction to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions

## üìò Overview
This project introduces **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** by implementing a complete **CI/CD pipeline** for a simple **Node.js web application** using **GitHub Actions**.  
Through this hands-on project, you‚Äôll learn how to **automate builds, tests, and deployments** ‚Äî ensuring faster delivery, higher code quality, and improved team collaboration.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts and benefits of CI/CD.
- Create and configure **GitHub Actions workflows** for automation.
- Set up and run a **Node.js web application** integrated with GitHub Actions.
- Implement automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- Apply DevOps best practices for modern software delivery.

---

## üí° Why This Matters
In modern software development, **automation is key**. CI/CD acts as the backbone of **DevOps**, enabling teams to:
- Detect and fix bugs early.
- Ship features faster and more reliably.
- Maintain consistent deployment standards.
- Improve collaboration between developers and operations.

> Think of CI/CD as a *smart kitchen* ‚Äî every order (code change) is cooked (built, tested, and deployed) automatically, ensuring speed, quality, and consistency.

## üß© Lesson 1: Understanding CI/CD

### What is CI/CD?
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Frequently merges code changes into a shared branch, running automated builds and tests.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically delivers code changes to production after successful testing.

### Benefits:
‚úÖ Early bug detection  
‚úÖ Faster release cycles  
‚úÖ Automated deployments  
‚úÖ Higher software reliability  

### Typical CI/CD Pipeline:
1. Code versioning (Git)
2. Automated build
3. Testing
4. Deployment to staging or production
5. Post-deployment verification

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lesson 2: Introduction to GitHub Actions

### üß≠ What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform** built into GitHub that allows developers to automate workflows ‚Äî from testing to deployment ‚Äî directly in their repositories.

### üîë Key Concepts
| Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Workflow** | YAML-defined automation process | Test & deploy Node.js app |
| **Event** | Trigger for workflow execution | `push`, `pull_request` |
| **Job** | A set of steps executed on a runner | Build & test job |
| **Step** | Individual action or command | Run `npm install` |
| **Action** | Predefined task or reusable command | `actions/checkout@v2` |
| **Runner** | Machine that executes jobs | GitHub-hosted Ubuntu VM |

---

## üß™ Lesson 3: Practical Implementation

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Node.js Application
```bash
# Initialize project
mkdir ci-cd-node-app && cd ci-cd-node-app
npm init -y
npm install express
```


index.js

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello world!'));

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`App running on http://localhost:${port}`));


commit and push your project to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

Step 2: Create Your First GitHub Actions Workflow

Inside your repository, create the following path and file:

üìÅ .github/workflows/node-js.yml

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run build
        run: npm run build --if-present
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

üß© Step 3: Understanding the Workflow

|Key	|Explanation|
|-----|-----------|
|on	|Specifies triggers (push, pull_request).|
|jobs	|Defines tasks for the workflow.|
|runs-on	|Virtual machine where the job runs.|
|steps	|Sequential commands or actions executed.|
|actions/checkout	|Clones the repository.|
|actions/setup-node	|Sets up Node.js environment.|
|npm ci	|Installs dependencies for clean builds.|
|npm test	|Runs automated tests.|


Step 4: Testing & Deployment

1. Add automated tests (using Jest or Mocha).
2. Extend your workflow with a deployment job to deploy your app to:
   - Heroku, AWS, or Vercel.
3. Example Deployment Step:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Heroku
  uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12
  with:
    heroku_api_key: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY }}
    heroku_app_name: "ci-cd-node-app"
    heroku_email: "you@example.com"
```

üß† Best Practices (Beyond the Basics)

- ‚úÖ Use secrets to store credentials securely (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables).
- ‚úÖ Implement branch protection rules to enforce quality gates.
- ‚úÖ Integrate code coverage tools for better test insights.
- ‚úÖ Add linting (ESLint) to maintain code quality.
- ‚úÖ Use status badges to display workflow results on your README.

Example badge:

```markdown
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/actions/workflows/node-js.yml/badge.svg)
```

## ü©µ Troubleshooting & Debugging Tips

|Issue	|Possible Cause	|Solution|
|-------|---------------|--------|
|Workflow not triggering	|Wrong event config	|Check on: block in YAML|
|Build fails	|Missing dependencies	|Ensure npm ci installs all modules|
|Permission errors	|Missing repo secrets	|Configure GitHub secrets properly|
|Deployment fails	|Invalid API key	|Regenerate and re-add secret token|


üåü Advanced Enhancements (For Extra Credit)

- Add multi-environment pipelines (staging + production).
- Implement Docker build and push images to GitHub Container Registry.
- Include Slack notifications for build success/failure.
- Use Matrix strategy for parallel testing on multiple OS (Windows, Ubuntu, macOS).
- Add automated code quality checks with tools like SonarCloud.

## üèÅ Conclusion

You‚Äôve successfully:

- Created and deployed a Node.js application.
- Built an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Understood core DevOps automation principles.

With this foundation, you‚Äôre now ready to design scalable, production-grade CI/CD systems ‚Äî a vital skill for modern engineers and DevOps professionals.
