This folder serves as a centralized repository for all my DevOps projects, exercises, and hands-on practice. It includes real-world scenarios, tool configurations, CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, containerization, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), cloud integrations, and monitoring setups.

Each subfolder documents a specific project or concept, including:
- Project overview
- Tools and technologies used
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Screenshots or diagrams (where necessary)
- Best practices and learnings

This collection is part of my continuous learning path as a DevOps engineer and is structured to reflect industry-relevant practices, emphasizing clarity, reproducibility, and automation.

The goal is to demonstrate both practical skills and theoretical understanding in key areas of DevOps, including:
- Version control (Git/GitHub)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Containerization (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- Cloud services (AWS, Azure)
- Monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)

This folder will be continuously updated as I progress in my DevOps journey.
